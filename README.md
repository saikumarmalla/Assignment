All the implentations were carried out in [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/) with the  [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) on my local computer.

### Features implemented

This is the initial phase of developement, the following features are implemented and many other features will be added in future.

1. Converts the words by replacing with the corresponding special symbols. e.g. 'exclamation mark' as '!', 'question mark' as '?' and many more.

2. Converts all the words that represents digits and numbers into corresponding values excluding space between them. e.g. 'five hundred thirty' as '530'.

3. Converts all the tuple terms followed by numbers/digits by repeating the number/digit that many times. e.g. 'double three'  as '33' and 'triple a' as 'aaa'.  

4. All the currency symbols are added as prefix to the figure. e.g. 'five dollars' can be written as '$5','six rupees' as 'â‚¹6'.


### Features yet to be implemented

1. We can include the feature maps(dicts or text files) for all the mathematical operations and formulas.

2. All abbreviations can be replaced with thier meaning.
